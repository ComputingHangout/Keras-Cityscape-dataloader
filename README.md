# Keras-Cityscape-dataloader

## Process
### 1. Download gtFine_trainvaltest.zip (241MB) [md5] and leftImg8bit_trainvaltest.zip (11GB) [md5] from https://www.cityscapes-dataset.com/downloads/
### 2. Extract them and change the paths (for me it is ../data/semantic-segmentation/cityscapes)
### 3. Specify img_size and batch_size
### 4. If you want you can change the number of classes, but that may lead to unexpected outcome
### 5. Enjoy
